👋 Hi there! I'm Sherine George, an aspiring MSBA graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, set to complete my journey in May 2024. Before diving into the world of Business Analytics, I honed my skills as a Software Engineer at an investment bank, where my passion for programming, data science, machine learning, and technology management flourished.

🔍 My professional journey is punctuated with extensive experience in data science and AI projects. These projects not only allowed me to apply my engineering skills in practical, impactful ways but also deepened my interest and expertise in the transformative power of data.

📚 Currently, at Carnegie Mellon, I'm expanding my horizon, working on cutting-edge data science/AI projects. This phase is enriching my knowledge, sharpening my skills, and preparing me for the next big step in my career.

💡 I'm deeply passionate about the potential of technology to transform education. In the long term, I envision starting my own venture in Edtech, aiming to innovate and improve learning experiences through the integration of AI and machine learning.

🌱 I'm always on the lookout for collaborative opportunities, learning experiences, and connections with fellow tech enthusiasts. Let's connect, explore, and create something impactful together!

📫 Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, ideas exchange, or just to say hi. Let's make the digital world a better place, one project at a time.
